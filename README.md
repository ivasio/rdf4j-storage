# Welcome to the RDF4J Storage repository

This is the storage code repository for the Eclipse RDF4J project. It contains the SAIL API, database implementations, and various reasoners.

Other components of RDF4J can be found in:
* [rdf4j](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j) containing client APIs (such as the Repository and Model API), RDF parsers and http client libraries
* [rdf4j-tools](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j-tools) containing the RDF4J Server, Workbench and Console applications
* [rdf4j-testsuite](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j-testsuite) containing common test suites and benchmarks

Please see [RDF4J.org](http://rdf4j.org) for detailed information about RDF4J, including
user documentation and [downloads of the latest release](http://rdf4j.org/download).

1. Fork the GitHub repository.
1. Create a new branch (starting from master) for your changes. 
1. Make your changes on this branch. Apply the [RDF4J code formatting guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j-storage/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-formatting). Don't forget to include unit tests.
1. **sign off** every commit (using the `-s` flag).
1. Run `mvn formatter:format` to format your code.
1. Run `mvn verify` from the project root to make sure all tests succeed (both your own new ones, and existing).
1. Use meaningful commit messages and include the issue number in each commit message.
1. Once your fix is complete, put it up for review by opening a Pull Request against the master branch in the central Github repository.
